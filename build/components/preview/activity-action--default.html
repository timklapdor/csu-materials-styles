    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch. We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun. We have big contacts we will promote you I really like the colour but can you change it, and can you make it pop.</p>
