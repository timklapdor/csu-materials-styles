  <p>I'm Emmett Berry, and I'll be your subject coordinator this session. Accounting 1 gives you a solid foundation for the kinds of information and concepts that business managers and accountants use to make decisions and manage a business. We'll focus
    on the uses of financial information, rather than the recording a spect of financial transactions. Expect to learn how to read, analyse, interpret and communicate your findings using spreadsheets and business reports.</p>
