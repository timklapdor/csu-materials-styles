A new colour palette has been developed to provide learning materials to utilise a wider colour palette than the faculty and brand colours. This is an acknowledgement of the importance of colour in creating visual flow and to improve  and enhance the user experience from a usability and navigational perspective. The colours chosen have been designed with accessibility in mind and can be previewed here: [Learning Material Colours](../components/detail/material.html). The colours are also provided with ```dark``` and ```light``` variations suitable for ```:hover``` states and a ```fade``` variations for light backgrounds.
