Welcome to the Learning Materials Living Style Guide. At the moment the guide contains information to utilise the styles embedded in CSU's Blackboard (Interact2) Theme - due to be rolled out in 2018. The idea behind this style guide is act as a starting point and to see the styles within it utilised in other media, mediums formats and systems - with the idea of creating greater consistency for staff and students across their learning materials.

The **Documentation** is designed to provide some of the context around the designs used and some of the information that has shaped some of the underlying decisions made around the development of this these styles.

The **Components** section of this site will guide you through the main aspects of the theme and provides visual examples of the HTML components and the required markup required.
