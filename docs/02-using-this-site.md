title: Using This Site
---

This site has been built using [Fractal](https://fractal.build) and combines a **style guide** with **code examples**. The new styles are made available by attaching a ```class=""``` attribute to a HTML tag. This is inline with the concept of [Semantic Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) and ensuring that [presentation is separated from content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation). This concept means that the display of content can be adapted without needing to re-author or edit content.

The Fractal window is divided into three parts:

1. **Menu** - To access the sections of the style guide
2. **Preview** - Where you can see markup and code as it would appear
3. **Code & Info** - Here you can see the markup and see how it's constructed

The **Menu** lets you navigate through the different components included in the theme.

The **Preview** lets you see those components as they would be styled.

The **Code & Info** The HTML panel let you see the actual source code that is being rendered and can be used as a reference or to cut & paste from. The View panel lets you see the variable elements of the component and can highlight elements that can be changed - like classes for colour, and placeholder text. Finally the Notes panel displays any notes that have been included to help explain the component.
