There will be a some issues that arise in using the new styles. In most instances these tend to be issues with parts of the code from reusing content from older sites or with legacy and redundant markup.

A range of common issues and solutions can are listed on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/timklapdor/learning-materials/wiki/) for this project.

A few simple fixes, such as removing inline styles using [CSSout](http://uimagine.edu.au/cssout), is all that is needed in most cases (which consists of a simple copy and paste process).

For larger problems they may require using [HTML Cleaner](https://html-cleaner.com/) can remove inline CSS and redundant and empty tags that are causing spacing problems.


For wide spread problems you can use the [SRS System](http://bit.ly/DLT-SRS) to log a job.

For issues that fall outside simple formatting problems you can log an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/timklapdor/learning-materials/issues). These will enter a workflow to be resolved.
